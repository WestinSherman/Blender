# Blender Guru's Donut Tutorial
I started this documentation of my Blener journey late in the game.
I dont really recall the very beginning, and I will start off at
Part9: Layout of the Blender Guru's Donut tutorial Because thats where I am at.
I will be using this page to document my progress and share my thoughts
on the process. I will be using the Blender Guru's Donut tutorial as a guide.

This is what my donuts look like so far:
<Image src={Wallpaper} alt="My donut" width={500} height={300} />

## Part 9: Layout
The lighting is definitely off. The next video is about lighting.
Getting the front donut to sit properly on the table was a bit finicky.
