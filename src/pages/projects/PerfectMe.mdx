# The Perfect Me
My goal with this project is to create a 3D model of a Half-Life combine soldier armored
version of the Perfect_Me.
#### Pintrest:
I started this project by looking at some references on Pintrest. I found a few images that I liked and
I will be using them as a reference for my model. I will be using the Half-Life combine soldier as a base
for my model. More accuratelyl, I will be using the armor from the Youtube video "Patient Zero"
by **TheParryGod**.
#### Boots:
Right now I am working on the boots. I have been looking on Pintrest and DeviantArt for some
references. I have found a few images that I think might be useful.
 I have also been actually working on the boots. Getting the correct perportions hasb't been easy.
 I have finished working on the boots for now, I do intend on working on it some more later.

#### Arm Armor:
 I moved on to removing the arm armor which took quite a long time.

#### Neck Armor:
Well I did start on it and had tried making it from a plane and then solidifying it but I couln't figure out
how to get the right shape. I ended up trying a cylinder and a phere and failed both.
I am now going to take a break from trying to build The Pergect Me and try some other tutorials to see if I can
learn some more tricks to help me solve my problems.
